1. Introduction
This assignment aims to assess your practical understanding of machine learning algorithms by
implementing an intelligent data-driven system, which can answer complex questions and make smart
decisions within a variety of contexts.

You will work with two to four people as a team. While limited exemplary project topics will be given, we
encourage you to create your own project based on the machine learning techniques taught in the class.

You can choose from a wide range of applications for your project in business, industry, multi-media,
gaming and the social-media domains. We expect an end-to-end machine learning system design and
development including data collection, feature analysis, data learning and performance evaluation.

You will demonstrate the developed system and answer some questions during a twenty minutes
walkthrough as a group. Each group member can take different roles during the development, but at the
end of the project, all individuals should be able to explain the details of the system framework and
performance by completing a short individual report.
Following learning outcomes are assessed in this task:
• understand and implement commonly used machine learning algorithms;
• apply machine learning techniques to develop applications which answer complex questions within
a variety of contexts including business, industry and the social media domain;
• analyse and evaluate techniques for prediction, ranking and recommending using technical and
contextual reasoning.

2. Group Project
Your project should be a data-driven machine learning projectincluding the following components:

A. Data collection

You need to collect a suitable dataset for your machine learning system. You are expected to apply
"data cleansing" operations when you prepare your data. If you apply supervised machine learning
approaches, you would also need to annotate each data point. After the data collection, please
separate 20%-30% of your data samples for testing and evaluation.
Please explain your data management plan and rise the ethical concerns with the tutor if the data
contains sensitive information.

B. Feature analysis

Define a feature space based on the data samples. Make use of data visualisation tools such as
histograms, scatter diagrams, parallel coordinates to observe the quality and correlation of the
features. You also need to set up a hypophysis after observing the feature distribution for the data
training.

C. Data learning

Design and develop a suitable learning model using machine learning tools such as Scikit-Learn and
TensorFlow. Depending on the algorithms, you may need to pre-process the data such as "scaling"
and "de-noising". You can use cross-validation approaches to estimate the performance. You also
need to keep the balance between under- and over-fitting through adjusting the hyperparameters
of the chosen machine learning algorithms. 

D. Evaluation

The focus will be the accuracy performance of the developed system. You need to fine-tune your
model to improve system accuracy performance. It would be better if you can compare more than
two different algorithms in the project. During the system evaluation, you need to analyse and
discuss the performance by using some scientific evaluation approaches such as ROC curves and
confusion matrices.

Using Python programming language and its machine learning packages, such as “scikit-learn”, “PyTorch”,
“Tensor Flow”, are the tools for your project development. However, you may need to add more
development toolkit for your specific task such as “OpenCV” for computer vision, and “Word2vec” for
sentiment analysis. If you need to use other development toolkits, especially some commercial software,
products, please discuss the ideas with the tutors.

You are encouraged to submit a project proposal by the 20th December 2019in order to get some early
formative feedback from your tutors.

Your group work should be submitted electronically through the module's Blackboard site as a single ZIP
file that contains all your source code before the deadline (Monday, 23 rd March 2020, at 15:00). If for any
reason you cannot submit your assignment to the Blackboard, then you should copy all of the
deliverables to a CD/DVD/Memory Stick and hand it into Cantor reception by the same deadline.

3. Demonstration

A demonstration of your group project will be held between the 23rd March and 24th of April 2020. The
timeslots for the demonstration will be made available via the module Blackboard site for your group to
choose. The demonstration will include twenty minutes of walkthrough followed by discussion and
feedback.

All team members must attend the walkthrough. All group members are expected to represent a certain
amount of work during the presentation to show their contributions to the project. Individuals who do
not attend their group walkthrough will be given a mark of zero for the demonstration.

4. Individual Report

Each group member needs to write an individual development report for this task. The report should cover
the entire project design and development pipeline, i.e. data collection, feature analyses, data learning and
performance evaluation.

The maximum length of this report is 2000 words (about four A4 pages) excluding references. You do not
need to include any pseudo-code or source code in the report, but some graphs and plots which may help
you to illustrate the contents are recommended.
You need to submit the report to the Blackboard by Monday, 23rd March 2020, at 15:00.
